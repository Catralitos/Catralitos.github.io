This project is a visualization of data regarding the Top 250 Narrative Features on Letterboxd. It features a variety of charts and graphs to allow users to get info on the greatest movies of all time.

It was developed as part of Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico's Visualization of Information course in 2021 using the JavaScript d3 package.

The code is available at [https://github.com/Catralitos/Letterboxd-Visualization](https://github.com/Catralitos/Letterboxd-Visualization).

It has sliders to filter movies by their runtime, number of ratings on the website, and average rating on the website.

It has a genre list for players to filter genres, as well as a radar chart to see the most popular genres and also conduct filtering.

At the center, there is a map where users can filter movies by country.

At the bottom there's a scatter plot correlating the movies' rating to their runtime or number of ratings.

There's also a bar chart displaying the directors and actors that most occur on the top 250 (or selected movies).

Finally to the left, there's a circular packing chart, where each decade is a circle, then each year, and finally each movie.

Clicking on actors or directors gets their filmography. Clicking on a particular movie gets its information.
