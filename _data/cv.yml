I excelled in working with Fátima Toolkit to create a rich scenario with engaging NPCs and concluded my thesis on Social Agents in Minecraft, where I designed and implemented an architecture that could be applied to create more believable NPCs with less user authoring. Also worked with VR, video editing, and other media production.
